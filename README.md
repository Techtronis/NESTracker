NESTracker will allow you to read data such as the initial price, release date and more about all Nintendo consoles ever released (from the Color TV Game up to the Switch OLED)

Now on Apple [Testflight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/wwep90dI)

Apple rejected it for the app store but I will keep updating it for testflight.
You can also download the IPA in the releases tab.

Will be making NESTracker open source in August 2024.
